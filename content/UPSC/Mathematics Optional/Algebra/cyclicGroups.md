**Example** The set $Z\_n = \\{0, 1, . . . , n - 1\\}$ for $n \geq 1$ is a cyclic group under addition modulo $n$. Again (was in case for group $Z$), 1 and -1 = n - 1 are generators.

**Example** $Z\_8 = <1> = <3> = <5> = <7>$.

**Theorem:** Let $G$ be a group, and let $a$ belong to $G$. If a has infinite order, then $a\_i = a\_j$ if and only if $i = j$. If $a$ has finite order, say, $n$, then $< a > = \\{e, a, a^2, . . . , a^{n-1}\\}$ and $a\_i = a\_j$ if and only if $n$ divides $i - j$. (Easy to prove)

**Corollary** For any group element $a$, $|a| = |< a >|$.
